# OPEN-SCHOOL-MANAGEMENT
Development repository for the Laravel OPEN SCHOOL MANAGEMENT (OSM). OSM aims at providing API for managing entities and assets of schools.

Design of OSM is based on the research from Nigerian Educational Curriculum. 

Development work for the OSM is conducted under the Code Skol IT Training program, with participants being major contributors to the project.The Open School Management system is aimed at providing services to various stakeholders in order to reach the goal of improving the quality and efficiency of delivering educational services to Secondary and Primary Schools. The listed services for a typical school management system will be too broad and wide to fit into a single project.  OSM however attempts to provide a prototype for running basic needs of schools in Nigeria. The following considerations were made in adopting a design for OSM. The design needs highlights:
The need of educationalist or professionals in education industry in managing a school;
The various stakeholders in a school systemThe various [human] communities associated with a school;
The academic services of a schoolThe non academic services of a school;

In very broad sense, OSM system will attempt to manage the following needs: 
Student Demographics;
Progression of students in meeting educational or development goals; 
Personnel contact information; 
Multiple types of scheduling of activities and tasks for various user groups;
Grade book to catalog students and teachers performance;
Reports showing various aspects of the school management and overall performance;
Transcripts and other documents which may be requested or sent to third parties on students’ or guardian requests;
A minimal Medical Records System to help manage students scheduling and performance with respect to their health care needs or challenges;
Attendance;
Parent Portal;
User Customizable Preferences;
User permission and access control;
Communication tools for internal messaging and general information distribution;
Support for multiple schools or school programs.

The listed services above will be provided as modules or combination of modules built on the target development platform. The design of each module will closely follow a defined structure or pattern to ease development, debugging, and testing. Furthermore, identifying the key problems to be managed by OSM helps define the scope of the software project.
